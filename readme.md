# Lottery Simulation


a tutorial from **Corey Shcafer** on how to simulate the Powerball lottery using Python. I have seen several lottery simulations online, but not many of them go in-depth to calculate all of the possible combinations. Thats why i created my own simulation based of **R&S Lottery in Nigeria** that goes through every win condition and simulates the lottery in the way it is played in a real-life situation.

The runtime for this project was more than 2 hours due to the looping.
